# 4bit-alu
A 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed and simulated using fundamental digital logic principles. Built from scratch with logic gates in Logisim to showcase a deep understanding of 
binary operations,control logic, and digital electronics.

FEATURES

Supports the following operations:

000 - Addition (A + B)

001 - Subtraction (A - B)

010 - AND (A & B)

011 - OR (A | B)

100 - XOR (A ^ B)

101 - NOT A

110 - Increment A

111 - Decrement A

4-bit result output

Carry flag

Zero flag

Built entirely from logic gates (no ALU IC).


EDUCATIONAL VALUE

This project demonstrates:

1)Core concepts in digital design 
2)Binary arithmetic & logic control
3)Custom CPU sub-component creation
4)Hardware simulation & verification

 TOOLS USED
 
1)Logisim — for circuit design and simulation
2)Pen & paper — for truth tables and logic planning
3)GitHub — for version control and portfolio display

 FOLDER STRUCTURE
 
alu_simulation.circ — Main Logisim file
